# AI Blog Writer — LangGraph DAG Definition
# This is the ENTIRE system wired together as a stateful graph.
#
# Flow:
#   START
#     → router          (decides: retrieval or generation?)
#       → retriever     (IF needs_retrieval=True)
#       → planner       (always runs after router/retriever)
#         → dispatcher  (fans out N parallel writers via Send)
#           → [section_writer_0, section_writer_1, ...N]  ← PARALLEL
#         → reducer     (merges all sections deterministically)
#   END
